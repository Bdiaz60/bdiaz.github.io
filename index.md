### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Part one was a very notable Lab. At the time, it was very confusing.
    Although getting a clone, and pushing my code for the first time
    was very exciting. 


* Lab 7 

    Part two was very interesting to me, as I have started playing blackjack
    with my brother. Being able to code a game, and tell him about it,
    is very impressive. 


* Lab 10

    Part two was very intersting on my behalf, since it was the time we
    started to learn about vectors. Being able to call out a specific
    term from a stored area was quite fascinating.
